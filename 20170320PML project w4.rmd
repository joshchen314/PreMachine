## Introduction  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement ¡V a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, my goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 circumstances to predict the circ in which they did the exercise.  

## Import Libraries
```{r, cache = T}
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
library(corrplot)
```
### Download the Data
```{r, cache = T}
trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile=trainFile, method="curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile=testFile, method="curl")
}
```  
### Read the Data
After getting the data, we have to import the two csv files into two data frames.  
```{r, cache = T}
trainRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-training.csv")
testRaw <- read.csv("./data/pml-testing.csv")
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
```
There are 19,622 observations and 160 variables in the training data set while there are 20 observations and 160 variables in the testing data set. The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome that we care about. 

### Clean the data
Then, we will clean the data and get rid of observations with missing values as well as some meaningless variables.
```{r, cache = T}
sum(complete.cases(trainRaw))
```

First of all, we get rid of columns with NA missing values.
```{r, cache = T}
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, colSums(is.na(trainRaw)) == 0] 
testRaw <- testRaw[, colSums(is.na(testRaw)) == 0] 
```  

Second, we get rid of some columns without contributing much to the accelerometer measurements.
```{r, cache = T}
classe <- trainRaw$classe
trainRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(trainRaw))
trainRaw <- trainRaw[, !trainRemove]
trainCleaned <- trainRaw[, sapply(trainRaw, is.numeric)]
trainCleaned$classe <- classe
testRemove <- grepl("^X|timestamp|window", names(testRaw))
testRaw <- testRaw[, !testRemove]
testCleaned <- testRaw[, sapply(testRaw, is.numeric)]
```

Finally, the cleaned training data set contains 19,622 observations and 53 variables while the testing data set contains 20 observations and 53 variables. The "classe" variable is still in the cleaned training set.

### Slice the data
Next, we could split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We would use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in other steps.  
```{r, cache = T}
set.seed(22519) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(trainCleaned$classe, p=0.70, list=F)
trainData <- trainCleaned[inTrain, ]
testData <- trainCleaned[-inTrain, ]
```

## Data Modeling
We could fit a predictive model for activity recognition using **Random Forest** algorithm. Ther reason is that this algorithm could automatically selects important variables and would be robust to correlate covariates & outliers in general. We will use **5-fold cross validation** when applying the algorithm.  
```{r, cache = T}
controlRf <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
modelRf <- train(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="rf", trControl=controlRf, ntree=250)
modelRf
```

Then, we could estimate the performances of the model on the validation data set.  
```{r, cache = T}
predictRf <- predict(modelRf, testData)
confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)
```
```{r, cache = T}
accuracy <- postResample(predictRf, testData$classe)
accuracy
oose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(testData$classe, predictRf)$overall[1])
oose
```
Hence, the estimated accuracy of the model is 99.42% and the estimated out-of-sample error is 0.58%.

## Predicting for Test Data Set
After getting rid of the `problem_id` column, we could apply this model to the original testing data set. 
```{r, cache = T}
result <- predict(modelRf, testCleaned[, -length(names(testCleaned))])
result
```  

## Appendix: Figures
1. Correlation Matrix Visualization  
```{r, cache = T}
corrPlot <- cor(trainData[, -length(names(trainData))])
corrplot(corrPlot, method="shade", tl.cex=0.6, tl.srt = 45, tl.col = "black")
```

2. Decision Tree Visualization
```{r, cache = T}
treeModel <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=trainData, method="class")
prp(treeModel) # fast plot
```
